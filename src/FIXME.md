- [x] vmman vm stopall fails on vm alpinedev or alpinestorage
- [x] vmman stopall -a will not work at all (silently returns)
- [x] vmman -c $hypervisor reset : double-stop, no start
- [ ] having multiple users on a single hypervisor in DB will mess the -a option.... (hint: https://golangbyexample.com/get-current-username-golang/)
