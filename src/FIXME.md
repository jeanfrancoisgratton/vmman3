- [x] vmman vm stopall fails on vm alpinedev or alpinestorage
- [x] vmman stopall -a will not work at all (silently returns)
- [x] vmman -c $hypervisor reset : double-stop, no start
- [ ] having multiple users on a single hypervisor in DB will mess the -a option.... (hint: https://golangbyexample.com/get-current-username-golang/)

= [ ] vmman1 legacy: I need to create my VM + pools under my own name.

- !!! [ ] vmman ls -a not working anymore ????
