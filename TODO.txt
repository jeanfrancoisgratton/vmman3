- QEMU connection string defaults to root@some-host.
    This needs to change with both a -u param, and a default value in some JSON file.

- Allows for some locking mechanism:
    Say that you have a vm create running against a specific template, on a given hypervisor.
    If you wanted to create a VM with the same template on another hypervisor, we'll need a mechanism to notify the
    Process that it's OK (or not) to proceed.

- Everything under helpers/ should be under its proper package.
    That's a relic from the Helper class in Python3's version, vmman1
