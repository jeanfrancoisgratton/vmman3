# vmman3
A Go-based libvirtd client, using the Cobra CLI manager.

From this tool you can:
- create/delete VMs
- start/stop VMs
- manage VM snapshots
- manage VM clusters
- edit resources (vpus, vmem, storage) of a given VM

The tool is hypervisor-aware, meaning it can manage VMs across a farm of hypervisors

### Issues:
None known, so far :p

### FixMe:
None, yet

### TODO:
Some packages (db !) are messy
